LaserVoting is Python code to detect laser spots in a camera and send data over OSC (OpenSoundControl).
It works with any number of laser pointers, computing an average spot location to transmit.
The screen is divided into regions, and the counts and centroids with each region sent to
and OSC receiver over UDP. This was written in Python 2.7.1+, and uses
OpenCV 2.3.1â€²s Python bindings, and
pyOSC 0.3.5b-5294 from http://trac.v2.nl/wiki/pyOSC
and numpy.
